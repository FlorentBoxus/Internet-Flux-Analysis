# IP Traffic Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyzed the packets flowing through the network monitor during various activities, such as streaming a video, participating in a video call, or downloading files. We extracted several meaningful statistics and developed machine learning algorithms to classify the type of packets, identify the protocols used, and gain further insights into the network traffic.

## Key Features
- **Traffic Analysis:** Detailed inspection of packet flows for different activities.
- **Statistics Extraction:** Compilation of relevant metrics like packet size, transfer rate, and latency.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of algorithms to:
  - Classify packet types (e.g., video, audio, file transfer).
  - Identify the underlying communication protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP).

## Objectives
- Understand the characteristics of different network activities.
- Enhance the ability to predict and categorize network packets.
- Provide insights into network optimization and security improvements.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Packet Capturing Tools:** Wireshark
- **Programming Languages:** Python

- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.

## Results
Our analysis revealed clear distinctions in traffic patterns between streaming, video calls, and downloads. The machine learning models achieved high accuracy in classifying packet types and detecting protocols, demonstrating the potential for real-time traffic monitoring and analysis.
